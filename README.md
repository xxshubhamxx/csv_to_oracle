A simple example to demonstrate the usage of function `cursore.executemany()` and `bind variables like :1 and :2`. This repository also shows us how to insert a CSV file as a table to oracle database. We have also separated the database credentials into config.py file. The only change you need to make to run `CSV_to_OracleDB.py` is changing the password to your database password. Leave the rest of the configurations unchanged. And run `CSV_to_OracleDB.py` and see the results.
